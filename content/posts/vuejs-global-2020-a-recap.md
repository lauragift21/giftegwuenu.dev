A couple of weeks ago, I had an amazing time speaking and attending  [Vue.js Global](https://www.vuejs.amsterdam/) a global online conference that held on September 17th and 18th. In this article, I'll share my thoughts and experience from attending the conference and some of my takeaways.

Overall, I'll say I had such a good time at the conference, even though it was online and we all miss attending in-person conferences. This one didn't feel so much like that because the community made it really come alive. There were so many memorable moments during the conference. 

I had the chance to be a part of the Speaker's Dinner a day before the conference and it was so much fun. You can tell my face is missing from the zoom call but I was present 😉. We had so much fun playing a Pub Quiz hosted by [Israel Roldan](https://twitter.com/isro_me)(P.S: My manager I'm so proud to be working with him!)

**TL: DR;**  The conference was so much fun and so many things I took away and looking forward to exploring them and soon using them at work. 

The conference was a [two-day conference](https://www.vuejs.amsterdam/program) packed with so much goodness and some exciting news everyone was looking forward to... I'm sure you already know what that is but more on that later.

## Conference Day 1 (September 17th)

We kicked off the conference with [Jos Gerards'](https://twitter.com/josgerards88) opening remarks and welcome to both attendees and speakers. I personally liked a lot of cool things from the conference I'll share some hints as we go on and you can also [let me know if you feel the same way](https://twitter.com/lauragift_).

Our hosts for the conference were [Maria Lamardo](https://twitter.com/MariaLamardo) and [Ben Hong](https://twitter.com/bencodezen) and they took over with **speaker** **introductions** and **QnA Moderation**. I must say they both did an amazing job pulling together and keeping everyone hyped for 2 days. That's no easy task not that I've hosted a conference before but I can totally tell it must have taken a lot of work to pull it off.

**Here's a rundown of some talks I attended from the first day of the conference, watch out for yours truly!**

Tim's talk was one of the best in terms of delivery...he went all out on this one and made us all look like amateurs! His talk covered Vite and Vitepress and it was a good introduction to Vite for me personally I've never used it in a project. I only remember when it was released and it was nice to see how

I was also a speaker at the conference and my talk covered an introduction to Gridsome and the possibilities of what you can achieve with the Jamstack. I showed how you can also extend the functionalities of a Gridsome Application by leveraging the API's it ships with. It was at this point technical difficulties set in and I wasn't able to complete my talk(it was prerecorded and the video was skipping). No worries though, I have a link to [my slides](https://speakerdeck.com/lauragift21/jamstack-ftw-static-site-generation-with-gridsome) and the recording in case you missed it or want to see the full version of the [talk on my channel](https://youtu.be/E3kyCodVVOM).

[Maya Shavin](https://twitter.com/MayaShavin) is a Senior Frontend Developer at Cloudinary. In her talk, she starts by sharing what the Jamstack is and went on to explore some tools in the Jamstack ecosystem and she mentioned something I think I needed to pay attention to because we have so many options of tools to choose from doesn't mean you have to use every tool in your application but instead think from the performance perspective. So asking the question does adding all of these services make my app more performant?

## Conference Day 2 (September 18th)

The second day of the conference kicked off with the organizer Jos Gerards welcoming attendees back for another day of amazing content. The talks for the day were all packed with news and amazing content in the Vue community. Ranging from a lineup of Nuxt.js seasoned featured speakers and the most anticipated presentation - Evan You's announcement(Wait for it...)

### The State of Vue 3 featuring Evan You's Announcement

This is one of the sessions we've been waiting for and anticipating to hear what news [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi) had for us in his Keynote which was streamed live. I guessed right on this one and I was right.

[Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) **"One Piece"** was released on the 18th day of September at 4:45 pm(WAT) I even got the time right that's to show you how excited I was! You can watch the recording directly. I just want to say I really appreciate the work that went into the release of Vue 3 when Evan shared the journey to Vue 3 and it took 2 years of active development to get this out the door so thank you to every member of the Core Team and Community at large doing the good work of contributing to make Vue the awesome framework that it is.

### After Party and Community Connections

Well, after the talks ended for the conference you'd think that it was the end of the conference since it's online and there's no physical after party. That was not the case for us we had a great time during the conference yes but still had a ton of people hanging around waiting for the after-party! 🎉 

Jos Gerards played some nice music we even had a conference Spotify Playlist where people can go add cool songs from where they're from. I liked that the [Hopin](https://hopin.to/) platform had almost the same experience you'll get from attending an in-person conference. I  checked out the Sponsors Booth and also did a couple of networking with some attendees for me this is one of the things I really appreciated about the conference. The chat was so lively and everyone was excited and you could feel it from wherever you're connected from around the world. 

## Takeaways and What I'm looking forward to next time!

The conference was very well put together and I had a lot of fun participating in it. Kudos and great job to the team for putting on such a great event.
