### **Hello World**

Hi! It's a sunny afternoon over here in Lagos Nigeria. I finally decided to start my personal blog. In case you were wondering My name is Egwuenu Gift Ndudi, Front End Developer from Lagos, Nigeria. I know it's clearly written on the blog but proper introduction is still required. This has been on my mind for a while now. Happy i'm finally putting this to work.

### Purpose

I decided to start #CNC2018 challenge Blog/Write more and writing is a great way of teaching other developers and myself better ways to solve coding problems. I intend to write about the things i learn and also include anything related to software development. P.S Mostly front-end development.


That was a quick introduction i intend to start posting every week. Hopefully this turns out great. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any comments or questions.
