# Learning In Public
I got inspired by [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/learn) Learn in Public roadmap. I've decided to start mine. There's so much out there I want to learn and I'm very aware I've got some gaps in my knowledge so my goal is to keep track of my learning journey and also write or document the things I learn.
