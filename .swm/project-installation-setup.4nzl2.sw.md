You will need a few things on your machine to run your local dev environment. Follow the steps below.

## Installations

*   Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), version `14.x`
    
*   Install [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/docs/gridsome-cli/) CLI
    
*   Install an IDE (preferably [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
    
*   Install Git (if you don't already have it on your machine).
    

## Getting the sources

Clone the repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lauragift21/giftegwuenu.dev
```

## Install Dependencies

*   Within the repository directory, run `yarn` to install the project's dependencies.
    
*   Then, run the project in development mode by running. `yarn dev`.
    

## Scripts worth mentioning ⚡️✨

Serve your code with a development web server

```

```

Pack for Production. This will generate installers.

```
$ yarn build
```
